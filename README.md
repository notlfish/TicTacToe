## Playing Tic Tac Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a strategy game between two players

# Game rules
The Tic Tac Toe board is a 3 by 3 grid of cells.

Tic Tac Toe is a turned based game in which each player marks one of the empty cells of the board each turn.

To win the game you have to put three of your marks in a line. It could be three in a row, three in a column, or three in one of the diagonals. The first player to accomplish this wins the game.

If all of the cells are occupied without any of the players winning, the game is a tie.

Example games:
X won with 3 marks in a row
```
+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |
+---+---+---+
| X | X | X |
+---+---+---+
| O | O |   |
+---+---+---+
```

O win with 3 marks in a column
```
+---+---+---+
| O | X |   |
+---+---+---+
| O | X | X |
+---+---+---+
| O |   |   |
+---+---+---+
```

X win with 3 marks in a diagonal
```
+---+---+---+
| X | X |   |
+---+---+---+
| O | X |   |
+---+---+---+
| O | O | X |
+---+---+---+
```
